        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>
          The FIBRA/REIT Investment Calculator was created by Alberto Saco Puntriano, a real estate 
          investment professional with experience across multiple markets. Alberto developed this tool
          to address the lack of specialized calculators for the unique considerations in REIT and FIBRA
          investments, particularly for cross-border investment strategies.
